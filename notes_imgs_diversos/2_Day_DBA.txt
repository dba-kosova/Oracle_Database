About Oracle Database
Oracle Database is a relational database with object and Extensible Markup Language
(XML) capabilities. In a relational database, all data is stored in two-dimensional tables
that are composed of rows and columns. Oracle Database enables you to store data,
update it, and efficiently retrieve it, with a high degree of performance, reliability, and
scalability







Oracle Database is composed of the following elements:
-       The Oracle software that you install on your host computer
-       The database, which is a collection of physical files on one or more disks
The database contains user data, metadata, and control structures. Metadata, or
data about the data, is the collection of information on disk that permits Oracle
software to manage user data. An example of metadata is the data dictionary.
Control structures (such as the control file and online redo log files) ensure the
integrity, availability, and recoverability of user data.
-       The Oracle instance, which is composed of the following:
– The background processes, which are the operating system processes or
threads that perform the work of accessing, storing, monitoring, and
recovering user data, metadata, and control files associated with the database
– The shared memory areas used by the background processes
-       Server processes that perform work on behalf of connected users and
applications, and the memory and temporary storage used by these processes
Server processes parse and execute SQL statements, and retrieve and return results
to the user or application.
-       Oracle Net, which is a software layer that enables client applications and Oracle
Database to communicate over a network, and the Oracle Net listener, which is a
process that listens for connection requests from the network.

Common Oracle DBA Tasks
As an Oracle DBA, you can expect to be involved in the following tasks:
-       Installing Oracle software
-       Creating Oracle databases
-       Performing upgrades of the database and software to new release levels
-       Starting and shutting down the database instance
-       Managing the storage structures of the database
-       Managing users and security
-       Managing database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views
-       Backing up the database and performing recovery operations when necessary
-       Monitoring the state of the database and taking preventive or corrective action as
required
-       Monitoring and tuning database performance
-       Diagnosing and reporting critical errors to Oracle Support Services
In a small to medium-sized database environment, you might be the sole person
performing these tasks. In large, enterprise environments, the job is often divided
among several DBAs, each of whom has a specialty, such as database security or
database tuning.









Tools for Administering the Database
The goal of this guide is to enable you to quickly and efficiently create an Oracle
database, and to provide guidance in basic database administration.
The following are some products, tools, and utilities you can use to achieve your goals
as a database administrator:
■ Oracle Universal Installer
Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) is a utility that installs your Oracle software and
options. It can automatically start Oracle Database Configuration Assistant to
install a database.
■ Oracle Database Configuration Assistant

Oracle Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA) is a utility that creates a
database from templates that are supplied by Oracle, or you can create your own.
It enables you to copy a preconfigured seed database, thus saving the time and
effort of generating and customizing a new database.



■ Database Upgrade Assistant
The Database Upgrade Assistant is a tool that guides you through the upgrade of
your existing database to a new Oracle Database release.
■ Net Configuration Assistant
Net Configuration Assistant (NETCA) is a utility that enables you to configure
listeners and naming methods, which are critical components of the Oracle
Database network.
■ Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control
The primary product for managing your database is Oracle Enterprise Manager
Database Control (Database Control), a Web-based interface. After you have
installed the Oracle Database software, created or upgraded a database, and
configured the network, you can use Database Control to manage your database.
Database Control also provides an interface for performance advisors and for
Oracle utilities such as SQL*Loader and Recovery Manager (RMAN).
Oracle also offers separately licensed Oracle Enterprise Manager management
packs, management plug-ins, and other products you can purchase to enhance the
capabilities of Oracle Enterprise Manager in specific environments.

Installing Oracle Database and Creating a
Database





To install your Oracle Database software, use Oracle Universal Installer (OUI). OUI is a
graphical user interface utility that enables you to install new Oracle Database
software. Online Help is available to guide you through the installation process.
During the installation process, you are given the opportunity to create a database. If
you choose to do so, then OUI automatically starts Oracle Database Configuration
Assistant (DBCA) to guide you through the process of creating and configuring a
database.
Before you start the installation process, see the following sections for information
about prerequisites and installation choices:
■ Checking Prerequisites
■ Deciding on Installation Choices
If you do not create a database during installation, then you must run DBCA at some
point after installation to create a database.






Note: After you create a database, either during installation or as a
standalone operation, you do not have to create another. Each Oracle
instance works with a single database only. Rather than requiring that
you create multiple databases to accommodate different applications,
Oracle Database uses a single database, and accommodates multiple
applications by enabling you to separate data into different schemas
within the single database. See "About User Accounts" on page 7-1 for
more information about schemas.







Checking Prerequisites
Before installing the software, OUI performs several automated checks to ensure that
your computer fulfills the basic hardware and software requirements for an Oracle
Database installation. If your computer does not meet a requirement, then an error
message is displayed. The requirements may vary depending upon the type of
computer and operating system you are using, but some prerequisites include:



■ There is a minimum of 1 GB of physical memory.
■ Sufficient paging space is available.
■ The appropriate service packs or patches for your operating system are installed.
■ An appropriate file system format is being used.




See Also:
■ Oracle Database Installation Guide for your platform for more
information about exact requirements




Deciding on Installation Choices


Oracle Universal Installer guides you through an interview phase where you specify
your choices for installation and database creation. The exact sequence of steps
depends on your operating system. As you progress through the installation, you are
presented with choices on how to configure the database.
■ Install Options
■ Installation Method
■ Installation Type
■ Software Installation Directories
■ Database File Location
■ Database Identifiers
■ About Advanced Installation






Install Options
You can choose to create and configure a database, or to only install the database
software.
You can create a preconfigured database or a custom-configured database during
installation. If you choose not to create a database during installation, then you must
run DBCA after installation to create a database.
Preconfigured databases are based on templates that Oracle provides or that you
create. Each Oracle-provided template is optimized for a particular workload type. See 






Installation Method


The installation methods are divided into Desktop Class and Server Class:
■ Desktop Class—This installation class is most appropriate for laptop or desktop
computers. It includes a starter database and requires minimal configuration.
■ Server Class—This installation class is for servers, such as you would find in a
data center, or used to support enterprise-level applications. Choose this
installation class if you need access to advanced configuration options.
During a Desktop Class installation, you make only basic choices. For a Server Class
installation, you choose either typical installation (where you make only basic choices)
or advanced installation.
During a Desktop Class or a typical installation, Oracle Database automatically installs
the sample schemas.








Installation Type
When you install Oracle Database during basic and advanced installations, you need
answers for the questions listed in this section. OUI provides default values for every
choice.




■ What type of database edition installation do you want to perform?
Your choices are:
– Enterprise Edition—This installation type is the full-featured Oracle Database
product that provides data management for enterprise-level applications. It is
intended for mission-critical, high-security online transaction processing
(OLTP) and data warehousing environments.
– Standard Edition—This installation type is suitable for workgroup or
department-level applications, and for small to medium-sized enterprises. It
provides core relational database management services and options and
includes an integrated set of management tools, replication, Web features, and
facilities for building business-critical applications.
– Standard One Edition—This installation type is suitable for workgroup,
department, or web applications. It provides core relational database
management services for single-server environments or highly distributed
branch environments. Oracle Standard Edition One includes all the facilities
necessary to build business-critical applications.
– Personal Edition (Microsoft Windows operating systems only)—This
installation type installs the same software as the Enterprise Edition, but
supports only a single-user, development and deployment environment.
■ What are your database configuration options?






Software Installation Directories
You must specify the directory in which the Oracle Database software is installed, or
the location where the product binary files are copied from the installation media. You
must choose a location that has enough disk space to contain the software and is
accessible by the operating system user performing the installation.
You also specify the location of the Oracle base directory, which is used by all Oracle
software products installed on the server. The first time you install Oracle Database
software on a server, you are prompted to specify the location of the inventory
directory, called oraInventory. This directory provides a centralized inventory of all
Oracle software products installed on the server. You should use the same value for
the Oracle inventory directory each time you perform an Oracle software installation
on the server


Database File Location
A database includes several files that store the user data, database metadata, and
information required to recover from failures. As an administrator, you decide what
kind of storage subsystem to use for these files. You can select from the following
options:
■ File System—This default option creates database files that are managed by the
file system of your operating system. You can specify the directory path where
database files are to be stored. Oracle Database can create and manage the actual
files.
If you are not certain about which option to use, then select File System (the
default).
