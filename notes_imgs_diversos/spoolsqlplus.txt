SPOOL
SPOOL is not available in iSQL*Plus.

Syntax

SPO[OL] [file_name[.ext] [CRE[ATE] | REP[LACE] | APP[END]] | OFF | OUT]

Stores query results in a file, or optionally sends the file to a printer. In iSQL*Plus, use the preference settings to direct output to a file.

Terms

file_name[.ext]

Represents the name of the file to which you wish to spool. SPOOL followed by file_name begins spooling displayed output to the named file. If you do not specify an extension, SPOOL uses a default extension (LST or LIS on most systems). The extension is not appended to system files such as /dev/null and /dev/stderr.

CRE[ATE]

Creates a new file with the name specified.

REP[LACE]

Replaces the contents of an existing file. If the file does not exist, REPLACE creates the file. This is the default behavior.

APP[END]

Adds the contents of the buffer to the end of the file you specify.

OFF

Stops spooling.

OUT

Stops spooling and sends the file to your computer's standard (default) printer. This option is not available on some operating systems.

Enter SPOOL with no clauses to list the current spooling status.

Usage

To spool output generated by commands in a script without displaying the output on the screen, use SET TERMOUT OFF. SET TERMOUT OFF does not affect output from commands that run interactively.

You must use quotes around file names containing white space.

To create a valid HTML file using SPOOL APPEND commands, you must use PROMPT or a similar command to create the HTML page header and footer. The SPOOL APPEND command does not parse HTML tags.

SET SQLPLUSCOMPAT[IBILITY] to 9.2 or earlier to disable the CREATE, APPEND and SAVE parameters. See SQL*Plus Compatibility Matrix to determine what functionality is controlled by the SET SQLPLUSCOMPAT[IBILITY] command.
