Oracle RAC Architecture 




-Oracle RAC hardware requirements
-Shared storage configuration options
-Oracle Grid infrastructure components
-Oracle Clusterware network configuration
-Oracle RAC connectivity cycle
-Oracle RAC database file locations 




Oracle RAC history 


oracle parallel server(OPS)
	-oracle 6.2 on VAX/VMS


oracle real application cluster(RAC)
	-oracle 9i



Oracle RAC Software stack 
-ORACLE GRID INSTRASTRUCTURE
-clusteware
	-manage the whole cluster
	-monitor the availability of the resources
	-controls the resources startup order
	-can be programmed for user applications
-ASM
-oracle database



-ORACLE GRID INSTRASTRUCTURE
	-is a suit of software packages which include a killer cluster 
	where and or key automattic a storage 



we need tho nodes to build up a cluster.

use public network- this is the network that appplication will use to connect to the 
oracle rac database 
	

node must be connected to a seprarete network dedicated to the cluster. 
privete network, dedicated to the cluster. 



communication between nodes is called 
heart bear traffic
vital performance its network must be very high speed its spend with must be at least one GP s.




virtual ip adrees: has an advantege ovet the public ip addres. 
if the notes goes down the traditional tcp/ip protocals,
normally waits for a long time out period before notifying the 
client about the an available connection. 


but in case of the virtual IP adress that we're immediately
notifies the client about it.


this way the current connection will quickly know about the failure and the future conneciton 





hardware componets oracle rac 


shared storage 
this storage is accessed by all the cluster with no cluster 
the storage can be connected with the nodes using either the fiber channel 
the storage tou need a volume manager or file system or 




oracle RAC:
cluster notes connected to the public network and this public network is the network
used by the clients
-all the nodes are connected to a shared storage system.


-load balancing on the cluster nodes.





ORACLE RAC: Engineedred systems
-oracle database applice(ODA)
-oracle exadata database machine 

from my personal experience one of the best options to build an oracle
like environment is to use an oracle engineered system an enginnered system is 
hardware designed developed and configured in a way 
that makes oracle database runs with best configuration and performance. 

it doesn't only save you the time to design a complex cluster of harware
architecture. 


it also provides its tools to easily manage the hardware instances and at 
the time of this recoeding
