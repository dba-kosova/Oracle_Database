What is oracle RAC database?

-a database running on a cluster of multiple servers that operate as a single 
database 

-this is opposed to a single-instance database 




-UNPLANNED DOWNTIME
-the advantage of this architecture is a fundamental requirement for same 
businesses if any server in the cluster fails down.
the database should continue its operation as normal.




-it provides a very high available database that protects you from the server hardware or operating system 









-PLANNED DOWNTIME 
-even if tou have a planned down time like for example you want to apply a patch
to the operating system 


-or a patch to the database or upgrading the server hardware. 
  

-if the database was running in a single instance in that serve the database
would not be available 


-of course some mission critial applications cannot afford that with a correct database. 


-you can turn off the datavase instance in that server perform your upgrade 
and then turn on the server  
again without havinf to shut down the database at all 



SLA IMPLEMENTATION
-autocorrect could be useful in more complex situantions
-avaliability 99.99%





HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY

-the workload of some applications is reached its peak in some spacific short time
-take that web site as an example 
in shopping seasons like in the black friday or any christmas the site 
is hammered by the orders.

the actions while the rest of the year the site is runninh low what workloads


-autocorrect allows you to add servers to it's a cluster that we need to fullfill 
the high workload demand 


once the work load goes back to its normal level oracle RAC can dynamically 
remove the instances 


this method of increasing the power of the cluster to see if the high demand 
from the application is HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY


VERTICAL SCALABILITY- SINGLE INSTANCE 






ORACLE RAC BENEFITS 

-HIGH AVAILABILITY 


-DATABASE SCALABILITY 


-LOAD BALANCING 
ITS ALLOWS YOU TO control how the applications are distributed on the 
cluster instances. 



-RESOURCE UTILIZATION 





ORACLE RAC DRAWBACKS



-ADDITIONAL LICENSE COST 

-ORACLE DATABASE ENTERPRISE EDITON: ORACLE RAC LICENSE IS SEPARATE

-database standard edition: oracle rac license is included, if the total number
of cpu sockets in all the servers in the cluster less than or equal to 4. 

-complicated hardware architecture and requirements 

-not desigded for distaste recovery 


-more complex dba adminstration skills compared to single-instance








should the firm use it?
