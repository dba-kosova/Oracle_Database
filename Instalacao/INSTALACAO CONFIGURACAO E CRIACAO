Checking the Hardware Requirement
-Memory Requirements
-Disk Space Requirements 
-System Architecture 
-Display requirements 


Memory Requirements:

Minimum: 1 GB of RAM

Recommended: 2 GB of RAM or more
To determine the RAM size, enter the following command:
$ grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo
or
$ free -h



Available RAM                  Swap Space Required
Between 1 GB and 2 GB          1.5 times the size of the RAM
Between 2 GB and 16 GB         Equal to the size of the RAM
More than 16 GB                16 GB



To determine whether the system architecture can run the software, enter the 
following command:

uname -m

note:
This command displays the processor type. Verify that the processor architecture matches the Oracle software release to install. If you do not see the expected output, then you cannot install the software on this system.



To determine the size of the configured swap space, enter the following command:

$ grep SwapTotal /proc/meminfo
or
$ free -h



To determine the available RAM and swap space, enter the following command:
$ free


Automatic Memory Management
Starting with Oracle Database 11g, the Automatic Memory Management feature requires more shared memory (/dev/shm) and file descriptors. The shared memory should be sized to be at least the greater of MEMORY_MAX_TARGET and MEMORY_TARGET for each Oracle instance on that computer. 


To determine the amount of shared memory available, enter the following command: # df -h /dev/shm/


Note:MEMORY_MAX_TARGET and MEMORY_TARGET cannot be used when LOCK_SGA is enabled or with HugePages on Linux





Disk Space Requirements:
The following are the disk space requirements for installing Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2)

1 GB of disk space in the /tmp directory

To determine the amount of disk space available in the /tmp directory, enter the following command:
# df -h /tmp


To determine the amount of free disk space on the system, enter the following 
command:
# df -h



The following tables describe the disk space requirements for software files, and data files for each installation type on Linux x86:


Installation Type            Requirement for Software Files (GB)
Enterprise Edition           4.5
Standard Edition             4.4



Installation Type            Requirement for Data Files (GB)
Enterprise Edition           1.7
Standard Edition             1.5






System Architecture
To determine if the system architecture can run the software, enter the following 
command:
# uname -m

2-Criação de diretoiros e pastas padrão e usuario e grupos- (Optimal Flexible Architecture)
REFERENCIA:https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e24324.pdf


5 Creating Required Operating System Groups and Users
 The Oracle Inventory group (typically, oinstall)
 The OSDBA group (typically, dba)
 The Oracle software owner (typically, oracle)
 The OSOPER group (optional. Typically, oper)


To determine whether these groups and users exist, and if necessary, to create them,
follow these steps:

1. To determine whether the oinstall group exists, enter the following command:

# more /etc/oraInst.loc
If the output of this command shows the oinstall group name, then the group
exists.


If the oraInst.loc file exists, then the output from this command is similar to the
following:
inventory_loc=/u01/app/oraInventory
inst_group=oinstall

The inst_group parameter shows the name of the Oracle Inventory group,
oinstall.



2. To determine whether the dba group exists, enter the following command:
# grep dba /etc/group

If the output from this commands shows the dba group name, then the group
exists.



3. If necessary, enter the following commands to create the oinstall and dba groups:
# /usr/sbin/groupadd oinstall
# /usr/sbin/groupadd dba



4. To determine whether the oracle user exists and belongs to the correct groups,
enter the following command:

# id oracle


If the oracle user exists, then this command displays information about the
groups to which the user belongs. The output should be similar to the following,
indicating that oinstall is the primary group and dba is a secondary group:

uid=440(oracle) gid=200(oinstall) groups=201(dba),202(oper)


5. If necessary, complete one of the following actions:
If the oracle user exists, but its primary group is not oinstall or it is not a
member of the dba group, then enter the following command:
# /usr/sbin/usermod -g oinstall -G dba oracle


If the oracle user does not exist, enter the following command to create it:

# /usr/sbin/useradd -g oinstall -G dba oracle

This command creates the oracle user and specifies oinstall as the primary
group and dba as the secondary group.


6. Enter the following command to set the password of the oracle user:
# passwd oracle







6 Configuring Kernel Parameters and Resource Limits
Verify that the kernel parameters shown in the following table are set to values greater
than or equal to the minimum value shown. The procedure following the table
describes how to verify and set the values.


Note: The kernel parameter and shell limit values in this section are
minimum values only. For production database systems, Oracle
recommends that you tune these values to optimize the performance
of the system. Refer to your operating system documentation for more
information about tuning kernel parameters.
TABELA PAGINA 15 




Check Resource Limits for the Oracle Software Installation Users

For each installation software owner, check the resource limits for installation, using
the following recommended ranges:

Table 1 Installation Owner Resource Limit Recommended Ranges
TABELA PAGINA 17 https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e24324.pdf


To check resource limits:
1. Log in as an installation owner.

2. Check the soft and hard limits for the file descriptor setting. Ensure that the result 
is in the recommended range. For example:
$ ulimit -Sn
$ ulimit -Hn



3. Check the soft and hard limits for the number of processes available to a user.
Ensure that the result is in the recommended range. For example:
$ ulimit -Su
$ ulimit -Hu



4. Check the soft limit for the stack setting. Ensure that the result is in the
recommended range. For example:
$ ulimit -Ss
$ ulimit -Hs


5. Repeat this procedure for each Oracle software installation owner. 
If necessary, update the resource limits in the /etc/security/limits.conf
configuration file for the installation owner. However, note that the configuration file
is distribution specific. Contact your system administrator for distribution specific
configuration file information.


Note: If the grid or oracle users are logged in, then changes in the
limits.conf file do not take effect until you log these users out and log
them back in. You must do this before you use these accounts for
installation.

The Oracle base directory

An optional Oracle data file directory


The Oracle base directory must have 4 GB of free disk space, or 6 GB of free disk space
if you choose not to create a separate Oracle data file directory.


Note: If you do not want to create a separate Oracle data file
directory, then you can install the data files in a subdirectory of the
Oracle base directory. However, this is not recommended for
production databases.




To create the Oracle base directory:
1. Enter the following command to display information about all mounted file
systems:
# df -h


This command displays information about all the file systems mounted on the
system, including:
 The physical device name
 The total amount, used amount, and available amount of disk space
 The mount point directory for that file system



2. From the display, identify either one or two file systems that meet the disk space
requirements mentioned earlier in this section.

3. Note the name of the mount point directory for each file system that you
identified.

4. Enter commands similar to the following to create the recommended
subdirectories in the mount point directory that you identified and set the
appropriate owner, group, and permissions on them:
# mkdir -p /mount_point/app/
# chown -R oracle:oinstall /mount_point/app/
# chmod -R 775 /mount_point/app/


For example:
# mkdir -p /u01/app/
# chown -R oracle:oinstall /u01/app/
# chmod -R 775 /u01/app/








8 Configuring the oracle Users Environment
You run Oracle Universal Installer from the oracle account. However, before you start
Oracle Universal Installer, you must configure the environment of the oracle user. To
configure the environment, you must:

 Set the default file mode creation mask (umask) to 022 in the shell startup file.
 Set the DISPLAY environment variable.




To set the oracle users environment:

1. Start a new terminal session, for example, an X terminal (xterm).

2. Enter the following command to ensure that X Window applications can display
on this system:
$ xhost fully_qualified_remote_host_name
For example:
$ xhost somehost.us.example.com


3.If you are not logged in to the system where you want to install the software, then
log in to that system as the oracle user.


4. If you are not logged in as the oracle user, then switch user to oracle:
$ su - oracle


5. To determine the default shell for the oracle user, enter the following command:
echo $SHELL


6. To run the shell startup script, enter one of the following commands:
Bash shell:
$ . ./.bash_profile


Bourne or Korn shell:
$ . ./.profile


 C shell:
% source ./.login


7. If you are not installing the software on the local computer, then run the following
command on the remote computer to set the DISPLAY variable:

 Bourne, Bash or Korn shell:
 export DISPLAY=local_host:0.0

 C shell:
 % setenv DISPLAY local_host:0.0




In this example, local_host is the host name or IP address of the local computer
to use to display Oracle Universal Installer.
Run the following command on the remote computer to check if the shell and the
DISPLAY environmental variable are set correctly:
echo $SHELL
echo $DISPLAY



Now to enable X applications, run the following commands on the local computer:
$ xhost + fully_qualified_remote_host_name
To verify that X applications display is set properly, run a X11 based program that
comes with the operating system such as xclock:
$ xclock


In this example, you can find xclock at /usr/X11R6/bin/xclocks. If the DISPLAY
variable is set properly, then you can see xclock on your computer screen.



See Also: PC-X Server or operating system vendor documents for
further assistance

8. If you determined that the /tmp directory has less than 1 GB of free disk space,
then identify a file system with at least 1 GB of free space and set the TMP and
TMPDIR environment variables to specify a temporary directory on this file system:


a. To determine the free disk space on each mounted file system use the
following command:
# df -h /tmp

b. If necessary, enter commands similar to the following to create a temporary
directory on the file system that you identified, and set the appropriate
permissions on the directory:
$ sudo mkdir /mount_point/tmp
$ sudo chmod a+wr /mount_point/tmp
# exit





b. If necessary, enter commands similar to the following to create a temporary
directory on the file system that you identified, and set the appropriate
permissions on the directory:
$ sudo mkdir /mount_point/tmp
$ sudo chmod a+wr /mount_point/tmp
# exit





* C shell:
% setenv TMP /mount_point/tmp
% setenv TMPDIR /mount_point/tmp



9. Enter commands similar to the following to set the ORACLE_BASE and ORACLE_SID
environment variables:
 Bourne, Bash, or Korn shell:
$ ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle
$ ORACLE_SID=sales
$ export ORACLE_BASE ORACLE_SID

 C shell:
% setenv ORACLE_BASE /u01/app/oracle
% setenv ORACLE_SID sales


In this example, /u01/app/oracle is the Oracle base directory that you created or
identified earlier and sales is the database name (typically no more than five
characters).



10. Enter the following commands to ensure that the ORACLE_HOME and TNS_ADMIN
environment variables are not set:
 Bourne, Bash, or Korn shell:
$ unset ORACLE_HOME
$ unset TNS_ADMIN

 C shell:
% unsetenv ORACLE_HOME
% unsetenv TNS_ADMIN




Note: If the ORACLE_HOME environment variable is set, then Oracle
Universal Installer uses the value that it specifies as the default path
for the Oracle home directory. However, if you set the ORACLE_BASE
environment variable, then Oracle recommends that you unset the
ORACLE_HOME environment variable and choose the default path
suggested by Oracle Universal Installer.







9 Mounting the Product Disc
1. Enter a command similar to the following to eject the currently mounted disc, then
remove it from the drive:
Asianux, Oracle Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux:




SUSE Linux Enterprise Server:
# eject /media/dvd


In these examples, /mnt/dvd and /media/dvd are the mount point directories for
the disc drive.



2. Insert the DVD into the disc drive.
3. To verify that the disc mounted automatically, enter a command similar to the
following:
 Asianux, Oracle Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
# ls /mnt/dvd
 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server:
# ls /media/dvd





3. To verify that the disc mounted automatically, enter a command similar to the
following:
Asianux, Oracle Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
# ls /mnt/dvd
 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server:
# ls /media/dvd


4. If this command fails to display the contents of the disc, then enter a command
similar to the following:
 Asianux, Oracle Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/dvd /mnt/dvd
 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server:
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/dvd /media/dvd
In these examples, /mnt/dvd and /media/dvd are the mount point directories for
the disc drive.




10 Installing Oracle Database

Server Configuration Checklist
Disk space allocated to the /tmp directory
At least 1 GB of space in the /tmp directory


Swap space allocation relative to RAM (OracleDatabase)
-Between 1 GB and 2 GB: 1.5 times the size of the RAM

Oracle Inventory(oraInventory) and OINSTALL Group Requirements
*or upgrades, Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) detects an
existing oraInventory directory from the 
/etc/


Groups and users
The OINSTALL group must be the primary group of all Oracle
software installation owners on the server. It should be writable
by any Oracle installation owne


Determine superuser (root) privilege delegation option for installation
*During a database or grid infrastructure installation, you are asked to run configuration scripts as the root user.



Set locale (if needed)
NLS (National Language Support) 





Check Shared Memory File System Mount
/dev/shm mount area is of type tmpfs  and is mounted 




User Environment Configuration for Oracle Database
*Review Oracle Inventory (oraInventory) and OINSTALL Group Requirements

Environment Variables
ORACLE_HOME, ORACLE_BASE, ORACLE_SID,
TNS_ADMIN 

Set the DISPLAY environment variable.

check                                      
Minimum local disk storage space 
task 
At least 7.5 GB for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.
Oracle recommends that you allocate approximately 100 GB to allow additional space for applying any future patches

Oracle Universal Installer Planning Checklist for Oracle Database Installation



Deployment Checklist for Oracle Database

Install Oracle Database software using Oracle Universal Installer (OUI)

Oracle DBCA



Checking and Configuring Server Hardware for Oracle Database



OUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) application.





Checking Server Hardware and Memory Configuration
grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo

grep SwapTotal /proc/meminfo

df -h /tmp



Determine the amount of free RAM and disk swap space on the system:
free


Determine if the system architecture can run the software:
# uname -m


Verify that the processor architecture matches the Oracle software release to
install. For example, you should see the following for a x86-64 bit system:
x86_64


Verify that shared memory (/dev/shm) is mounted properly with sufficient size:
df -h /dev/shm


The df-h command displays the filesystem on which /dev/shm is mounted, and also displays in GB the total size and free size of shared memory.




Automatically Configuring Oracle Linux with Oracle Preinstallation RPM

Use Oracle Linux RPMs to simplify operating system configuration in preparation for
Oracle software installations.


Oracle recommends that you install Oracle Linux 6 or Oracle Linux 7 and use Oracle
Preinstallation RPM to configure your operating systems for Oracle Database and
Oracle Grid Infrastructure installations.




Configuring a server using Oracle Linux and the Oracle Preinstallation RPM consists
of the following steps:
Install Oracle Linux.
Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN)




Configure Additional Operating System Features


Oracle recommends that you configure your operating system before starting
installation








Guidelines for Linux Operating System Installation

You can also search for "Linux reduced set of packages" to locate the instructions.



RPM Packages for Completing Operating System Configuration

Oracle Preinstallation RPM for your Oracle Linux 6 or Oracle Linux 7 kernel (oracle-database-server-12cR2-preinstall).



Completing a Default Linux Installation

If you do not install the Oracle Preinstallation RPM, then Oracle recommends that you
install your Linux operating system with the default software packages (RPMs).


Oracle recommends that you do not customize the RPMs during installation




About Oracle Linux with the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel
It is based on a recent stable mainline development Linux kernel, and also includes optimizations developed in collaboration with Oracle Database, Oracle middleware, and Oracle hardware engineering teams to ensure stability and optimal performance for the most demanding enterprise workloads
